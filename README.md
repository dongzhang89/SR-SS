## Contact
* This project is a demo implementation for SR. 
* If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact: dongzhang@njust.edu.cn

## Installation Instructions
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:dongzhang89/SR-SS.git
cd SR-SS
```

- Install PyTorch 0.4.0:
```bash
pip install pytorch==0.4.0
```
GPU is not necessary, but it will be very slow without GPU.

- Install Python Package
```bash
pip install -r requirements
```
Tensorflow is necessary for tensorboardX. If you don't want to use tensorboardX for visualization, delete it.

- Dataset preparation
We use the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset in SR. Go to the [official webpage](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/) and download the training images. We use the augmented pseudo-labels in experiments. The final file structure is shown belowï¼š
```
data
  |- VOC2012
    |- SegmentationClassAug_pseudo_label #label path
    |- JPEGImages #image path
```

## Usage
### Demo
Test on a single image could be done by running:
```
python demo.py --img_path path --model path/weight
```
You can get a similar image as:

![input](imgs/result.png)

* Result image could be saved as **result.jpg**.
* To be noticed, the trained model can be loaded by:
```
checkpoint = torch.load(model_path)
net.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model'])
```

### Train
Training your own model could be done by running:
```
python trainval.py
```
* Change the command line arguments if necessary. 
* To speed up the training process, we use the loss for the presences of object categories instead of classification, but the performance of these two methods is quite similar.
* Please first train the model by 10000 iterations using only MEA loss and switch on the SR loss for the remaining iterations.

### Test
Testing your trained model could be done by running:
```
python test.py --model=path/model
```
* Then you can see the final result on PASCAL VOC2012 after a while. 
* We believe designing more complicated training weight for loss items also benefits for the model performance.

### TensorboardX
Monitor your training process with tensorboardX. Run:
```
tensorboard --logdir=$DEEPLAB_V2_PYTORCH/logs/loss_lr/lr --port=7001
```
Then open your firefox or chrome, and visit localhost:7001.
